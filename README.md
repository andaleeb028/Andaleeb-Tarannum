Computer Vision
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs â€” and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. 
If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.

The code in ComputerVision.ipynb file is the simple code for image processing, which uses PIL library of python to read the image and numpy for data processing.
The numpy extracts the pixels in 2D array and then takes the average to get the threshold and verify if the given image is day or night.
You can edit the image path and try using your own image it will give you fantastic result.
Also this code can be used to to construct a feature in digital camera which will auto-detect and suggest to the photographer whether the picture is clicked in daytime or night time.

You can only implement this feature for cases which are directly distinguishable to the eyes(and not fuzzy scenarios such as dawn,dusk and sunrise,overcast skies which might 
require more complex  aperture adjustments on the camera).
